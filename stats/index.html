        <p>These statistics are collected in a privacy preserving way. No IP addresses are stored, only the number of times a certain configuration is compiled per day is stored.</p>

        <div id="pages" class="mb-3">
          <table>

        <p>Below are the number of compile jobs of the past month. "Initial" jobs are those that happen when a page is loaded or a different target is selected (meaning, it wasn't modified). "Modified" means that the user changed the code in some way, and the simulation was automatically updated as a result.</p>

        <p>The graph below shows the different compile targets and how often they've been used in the playground.</p>
